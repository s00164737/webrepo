                    <h3>Strandhill</h3>
                    <p> is a coastal town and townland on the Coolera Peninsula in County Sligo,
                         Ireland.
                          The old name appears to be Ros Dragnige (see Killaspugbrone).
                          Strandhill is situated at the western base of Knocknarea on the CÃºil Irra (Coolera) peninsula in Sligo Bay,
                           7 km (4 mi) west of the centre of Sligo town, and faces the Atlantic Ocean. Although the main part of the
                            village lies within the townland of Strandhill, it also extends into the townlands of Killaspugbrone and
                             Carrowbunnaun. The area is well known for surfing, as well as walks.
                             Strandhill's surrounding areas include the mountain of Knocknarea, Coney Island, Culleenamore beach, 
                             and Dorrins Strand. Much of the terrain consists of marram-covered dunes, and the local council has had 
                             to undertake various measures throughout the years to combat coastal erosion.

                        Strandhill is a vast beach break capable of holding huge waves in the right conditions. Surfing is usually best when
                         the tide is on the push in from mid to high tide.
                        While Strandhill's beach is renowned for surfing, it is not safe for swimming.
                         The nearby strand at Culleenamore is suitable for paddling.
